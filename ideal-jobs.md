## Ideal Jobs Summary and Analysis

There are two very distinct career plans evident in the chosen ideal jobs by members of the team.

The first career type is very clearly along the lines of technical team leadership with elements of project management. These job roles are positions where the incumbent is responsible for providing direction of operational activities in an ICT environment that requires many years of experience in systems management, and development.

The second career type is focused on software development of different types of systems. These roles require experience in a number of programming languages such as C++, Python, Swift, Objective C, Java and C#. They also deem highly desirable an understanding of software development methodologies and modern software development environments. In addition, the ability to use software to develop solutions to real world problems is also one of the requirements for these roles.

While these two career paths follow different specifics, they are both similar in some respects. They require a number of years of experience in similar roles, and the environments in which they operate are almost identical. The environment is based around creating, managing and delivering solutions that requires knowledge of technology systems, the ability to develop software to interact with systems and the leadership to guide other individuals to achieving the outcomes required.

So far as the dynamic of the group is concerned, with relation to the ideal jobs, the overall career direction of all team members is very similar. Each person desires a role that creates software based solutions. This desire fits in nicely with the content of this course as well as the other courses likely to be undertaken in the coming study periods.
