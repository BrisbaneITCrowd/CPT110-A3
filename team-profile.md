## Team Profile Summary and Analysis

The results from the three personality tests completed by each member of the team indicates that while there are a number of similarities, there are also comparative differences. The common personality traits that each person has, shows that there is a solid foundation of a task focused, analytical and collaborative work ethic that will prove very useful for this assignment as well as any future assignments that this same group works on together.

While there are a number of introverted personalities, the contrasting extraverted tendencies of others in the group will provide a good balance of leadership and group dynamic.

Everyone shows an openness and a level of agreeableness that will encourage a positive, supportive and level of inclusion for all team members. Overall, and based on the test results, the team should achieve a good working environment, during both face to face meetings, as well as remote, virtual meetings, that will focus on productive, task oriented outcomes.

Maintaining this personality momentum will most likely be the only challenge as the course progresses and the work loads increase. However, after the initial face to face meeting held last Saturday, there are very positive indications that each team member will be able to contribute thoroughly while at the same time providing a supportive environment for any team member that requires assistance.
